# A-Human-Learning-Machine-Learning
A repository for me (aforementioned human) to experiment, practice, and teach myself things related to statistics, machine learning, and mathematical modeling.

I'm treating this as part self-study notes, part code snippets, part personal resource list, and part mini project repo.

Current topics covered:

### Analysis_and_Mini_Projects

### Coding_and_Engineering

### Math_and_Algorithms
- PCA
